Show how to use a depth-first search of an undirected graph G to
identify the connected components of G, so that the depth-first forest
contains as many trees as G has connected components. More precisely,
show how to modify depth-first search so that it assigns to each vertex v
an integer label v.cc between 1 and k, where k is the number of
connected components of G, such that u.cc = v.cc if and only if u and v
belong to the same connected component.
