20.3-2
Show how depth-first search works on the graph of Figure 20.6. Assume
that the for loop of lines 5â€“7 of the DFS procedure considers the
vertices in alphabetical order, and assume that each adjacency list is
ordered alphabetically. Show the discovery and finish times for each
vertex, and show the classification of each edge.
