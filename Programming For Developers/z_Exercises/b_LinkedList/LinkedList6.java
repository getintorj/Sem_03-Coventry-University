★ 10.2-6
Explain how to implement doubly linked lists using only one pointer
value x.np per item instead of the usual two (next and prev). Assume
that all pointer values can be interpreted as k-bit integers, and define
x.np = x.next XOR x.prev, the k-bit “exclusive-or” of x.next and x.prev.
The value NIL is represented by 0. Be sure to describe what information
you need to access the head of the list. Show how to implement the
SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE operations on such a list. Also show
how to reverse such a list in O(1) time.
