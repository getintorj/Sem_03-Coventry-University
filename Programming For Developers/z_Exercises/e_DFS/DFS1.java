20.3-1
Make a 3-by-3 chart with row and column labels WHITE, GRAY, and
BLACK. In each cell (i, j), indicate whether, at any point during a
depth-first search of a directed graph, there can be an edge from a
vertex of color i to a vertex of color j. For each possible edge, indicate
what edge types it can be. Make a second such chart for depth-first
search of an undirected graph.
