The transpose of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph GT = (V, E
T),
where E
T = {(v, u) ∈ V × V : (u, v) ∈ E}. That is, GT is G with all its
edges reversed. Describe efficient algorithms for computing GT from G,
for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of G.
Analyze the running times of your algorithms.
