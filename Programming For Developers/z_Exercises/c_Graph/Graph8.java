20.1-8
Suppose that instead of a linked list, each array entry Adj[u] is a hash
table containing the vertices v for which (u, v) âˆˆ E, with collisions
resolved by chaining. Under the assumption of uniform independent
hashing, if all edge lookups are equally likely, what is the expected time
to determine whether an edge is in the graph? What disadvantages does
this scheme have? Suggest an alternate data structure for each edge list
that solves these problems. Does your alternative have disadvantages
compared with the hash table?
