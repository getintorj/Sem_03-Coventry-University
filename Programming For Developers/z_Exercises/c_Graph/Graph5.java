The square of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph G2 = (V, E2)
such that (u, v) âˆˆ E2 if and only if G contains a path with at most two
edges between u and v. Describe efficient algorithms for computing G2
from G for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations
of G. Analyze the running times of your algorithms.
