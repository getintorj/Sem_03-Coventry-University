20.1-4
Given an adjacency-list representation of a multigraph G = (V, E),
describe an O(V + E)-time algorithm to compute the adjacency-list
representation of the “equivalent” undirected graph G′ = (V, E′), where
E′ consists of the edges in E with all multiple edges between two vertices
replaced by a single edge and with all self-loops removed.
