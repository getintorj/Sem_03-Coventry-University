20.2-6
Give an example of a directed graph G = (V, E), a source vertex s ∈ V,
and a set of tree edges Eπ ⊆ E such that for each vertex v ∈ V, the
unique simple path in the graph (V, Eπ) from s to v is a shortest path in
G, yet the set of edges Eπ cannot be produced by running BFS on G, no
matter how the vertices are ordered in each adjacency list.
