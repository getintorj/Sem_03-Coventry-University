20.4-3
Give an algorithm that determines whether an undirected graph G = (V, E) contains a simple cycle.


Your algorithm should run in O(V) time, independent of |E|.

Step1: Initialise an integer count = 0;
Step2: Take one vertex.
Step3: Find its adjacent vertices and store them in an array
Step4: Traverse through the array and repeat at Step 2.
Step5: After the end of traverse. if(count > vertices)
                                        a cycle exists
