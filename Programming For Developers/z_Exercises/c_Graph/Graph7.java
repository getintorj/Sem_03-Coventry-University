20.1-7
The incidence matrix of a directed graph G = (V, E) with no self-loops is
a |V| Ã— |E| matrix B = (bij) such that

bij = { -1 if edge j leaves vertex i,
         1 if edge j enters vertex i,
         0 otherwise

Describe what the entries of the matrix product BB^T represent, where B^T is the transpose of B.
