20.2-7
There are two types of professional wrestlers: “faces” (short for
“babyfaces,” i.e., “good guys”) and “heels” (“bad guys”). Between any
pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry. You are
given the names of n professional wrestlers and a list of r pairs of
wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an O(n + r)-time algorithm
that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers
as faces and the remainder as heels such that each rivalry is between a
face and a heel. If it is possible to perform such a designation, your
algorithm should produce it.
