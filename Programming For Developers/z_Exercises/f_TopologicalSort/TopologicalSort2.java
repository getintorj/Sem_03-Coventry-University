20.4-2
Give a linear-time algorithm that, given a directed acyclic graph G = (V,E) and two vertices a, b ∈ V,
returns the number of simple paths from a to b in G.

For example, the directed acyclic graph of Figure 20.8
contains exactly four simple paths from
vertex p to vertex v: 〈p, o, v〉, 〈p, o, r, y, v〉, 〈p, o, s, r, y, v〉, and 〈p, s, r, y, v〉.

Your algorithm needs only to count the simple paths, not list them.
